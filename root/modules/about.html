        <h2>The Story Behind The Sound</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my sonic universe. 
          I’m Owirri, a Kenyan singer-songwriter and vocalist, weaving my melodies from the raw threads of life. 
          My music is more than sound—it’s a reflection of my truth, a journey of self-discovery, and an invitation for others to find solace in shared emotions. 
          Every song I create is an extension of my soul, a sonic therapy session for myself and for those who relate to it.
          Here, we feel seen, heard, and understood.

        <h2>AT THE CORE OF MY CREATIVITY LIES;</h2>
        <h3>Cultural and personal identity🌍</h3>
        <p>As a testament to the beauty of blending my roots with evolution, 
            I infusing my sound with Afro melodies and lyrical expressions that 
            honor my past while embracing my future. 
            I express myself in three languages, seamlessly weaving Swahili, 
            English, and Luo into my lyrics, allowing my heritage to shine through 
            in a contemporary soundscape. 
            My aesthetic, much like my music, is an Afro-fusion of bold yet soft elements, 
            embodying both cultural nostalgia and present-day authenticity.</p>

            <h3>Authenticity and vulnerability🍂</h3>
        <p>For as long as I can remember, writing has been my sanctuary. 
            I first turned to journaling as a way to navigate my emotions, 
            filling pages with unspoken truths and quiet reflections. 
            Over time, these raw, vulnerable entries evolved into poetry, 
            then into a personal blog where I bared my thoughts to the world. 
            Music became the next chapter—a space where words met melody, and 
            vulnerability became power. Each lyric, an unfiltered glimpse into 
            my experiences, emotions, and my healing process.</p>

            <h3>Empowerment and resilience💪</h3>
        <p>Music has been my sanctuary, my escape, and my source of strength. 
            Whenever I’ve felt lost, writing has been my way of finding myself 
            once again—a beacon pulling me out from the deepest, darkest trenches. 
            Through my lyrics, I pour out frustrations, fears, and the deepest parts 
            of myself, but in that release, I also find something much greater—empowerment. 
            My songs don’t just carry pain; they carry the resilience to rise above it. 
            And in sharing my journey, I hope others find the strength to do the same.</p>

        <h2>Mission🎶✨❤️</h2>
        <p>To create music that heals, inspires, and connects. 
            Through authenticity and emotional storytelling, 
            I aim to communicate the unspoken, giving voice to emotions 
            rarely expressed. 
            My craft is my joy, my therapy, and my gift to the world—a 
            space where vulnerability meets rhythm, and souls find solace.</p>

        <h3>Vision🚀🌍🔊</h3>
        <p>To be a powerful influence in music, shaping a legacy of artistry that transcends sound. 
            I aspire to touch lives, build a name that resonates beyond melodies, and create a movement 
            where music becomes a bridge for self-expression, healing, and cultural identity—all while 
            enjoying every step of the journey.</p>

        <h2>🎤 Recent Performances</h2>
        <p>This being my second year, I’ve taken my music from personal reflections to a few live audiences, 
            sharing my voice and story on different stages:

        <h3>Behind the mic🎤:</h3>
        <p>Many people don’t know this, but aside from creating music, 
            I have a deep love for Statistics and Data Science! 📊 
            I’ve spent years exploring numbers, trends, and patterns—analyzing data to uncover hidden stories. 
            Now, I’m on a mission to fuse my analytical side with my artistry, using data-driven insights to 
            shape my music strategy, track streaming trends, and connect with my audience in innovative ways. 
            Who knew numbers and melodies could go hand in hand?

        <h2>Fun & Unexpected Personality Traits:</h2>
        🎸 I love to play my guitar but bar chords is where i draw my line, her name is Snow.
        🎭 I’ve always had an interest in dancing—one of these fine days, you’ll see my choreography video!
        🤓 I love me a good read—my current read is “Mistaken Identity” by Scottline Lisa.
        🎧 The first song I ever composed was a short silly chorus about being punished by my 
        parent when i was…9 years old.</p>

        <h2>Upcoming Shows</h2>
        <img src="assets/hands.jpg" alt="x" width="300" height="300" />
        <h3>What Love Looks Like Pt.1 | EP Launch</h3>
        <p>
          Feelings are less expressed by words alone. Especially for feelings as
          intense as love, one must be intentional in communicating them for
          clear results. Love is sweet — and this EP says that in my language of
          chords and melodies. “What Love Looks Like” Pt. 1 captures the beauty,
          tension, and joy of love in all its forms, through the lens of a young
          African creative navigating culture, romance, and soft rebellion.
